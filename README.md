Introduction

In this project, my goal was to address four coding-related questions. For this purpose, I utilized an existing file named "sales"
(which I also included in the project files) and extracted the necessary data from it.

Here are the 4 questions:
1) How to read the data from the spreadsheet?
• Import the Pandas library to my phycarm.
• Find the pathway for the sales file.
• Used the print command for reading.
2) How can I collect all of the sales from each month into a single list?
Monthly Sales: [6226, 1521, 1842, 2051, 1728, 2138, 7479, 4434, 3615, 5472, 7224, 1812]   
• Using loops.
• Used the print command if it's a correct code.  
3) How to output the total sales across all months?
• Using the monthly sales list, and defining to system first. Calculate the total sales using sum function to add up al the values in the list.
total sales across all months: 45542
4) Create a simple bar chart to visualize monthly sales
• Import the Matplotlib library to my phycarm.
• Create a simple bar chart to visualize monthly sales.


Learnings:

Utilized Python, specifically leveraging the Pandas library, to conduct a comprehensive analysis of sales data. The focus was on data manipulation, calculating total sales, and presenting insights through visualization. 
Successfully located and specified the file path for the sales data. Implemented print command to effectively read, and display data.  
Executed code to accurately calculate and present the total sales across all months. 
Utilized Python, employing libraries such as Matplotlib, to create visually insightful representations of the data.
